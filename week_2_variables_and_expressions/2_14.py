# 2.14 LAB: Expression for calories burned during workout

# Write a program using inputs age (years), weight (pounds), heart rate (beats per minute), and time (minutes), respectively. Output the average calories burned for a person.

# Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
# print(f'Calories: {calories:.2f} calories')

''' Calories = ((Age x 0.2757) + (Weight x 0.03295) + (Heart Rate x 1.0781) â€” 75.4991) x Time / 8.368 '''

''' Type your code here. '''
age = float(input())
weight = float(input())
bpm = float(input())
time = float(input())

calories = ((age * 0.2757) + (weight * 0.03295) + (bpm * 1.0781) - 75.4991 ) * (time / 8.368 )

print(f"Calories: {calories:.2f} calories")
