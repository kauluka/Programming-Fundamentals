# 8.19 LAB: Contact list

# A contact list is a place where you can store a specific contact with other associated information such as a phone number, email address, birthday, etc. Write a program that first takes in word pairs that consist of a name and a phone number (both strings), separated by a comma. That list is followed by a name, and your program should output the phone number associated with that name. Assume the search name is always in the list.

# Ex: If the input is:

# Joe,123-5432 Linda,983-4123 Frank,867-5309
# Frank
# the output is:

# 867-5309

''' Type your code here. '''
word_nums = input()
return_name = input()

mydict = dict(e.split(',') for e in word_nums.split(' '))
print(mydict[return_name])
